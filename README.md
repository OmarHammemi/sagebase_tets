Yes, I also had it yesterday, and I've done this command to fix it:

```
npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-env && npm cache clean --force

```

This is a solution that I found myself after debugging the build process. It seems there's an issue with the babel dependencies not being properly installed or cached incorrectly.
